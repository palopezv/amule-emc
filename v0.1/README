1. Compilation and Installation

1.1 Requirements
 - wxwidgets and crypto++ development files
 - aMule CVS source (you have to run the configure
   script at least once to create config.h)

1.2 The compile script
 Open the script 'compile' with a text
 editor and point the AMULE_SRC variable to the
 aMule CVS source folder. (e.g. '/opt/amule-cvs/')
 Now you can execute the compile script. The script
 will create all necessary files and run the binary
 to test its functionality.

1.3 Installation
 Copy the amule-emc binary /usr/bin, /usr/local/bin or
 where ever you want to keep it.
 e.g.: 'sudo cp amule-emc /usr/local/bin'
