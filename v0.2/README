2006-2007 Johannes Krampf <wuischke@amule.org>

This is free software under the GPL. See license.txt for license information.

See 'INSTALL' file for installation information.

This is the first development release of amule-emc, an emulecollection support
programm for aMule.
Current version uses the ed2k link handler for aMule to add the links to
aMule. Please make sure the ed2k binary is properly installed.

Usage: amule-emc emulecollection file


Possible problems: The support for filesizes bigger than 4GB seems to be bugged,
this is currently being researched.

Please report any other problems or successful usage on non-Linux platforms
to me.
